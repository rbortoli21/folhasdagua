## How it Works

All hydroponic producers face untreated waste in vegetable production, the main one being product loss due to lack of water. The solution consists of the idea of two sensors monitoring the water flow at the inlet and outlet of a hydroponic bench, showing real-time values in the system so that the producer can access data related to their crop. If a problem occurs in production such as: lack of water, clogged pipes, power outages, among others, a notification is sent to the producer's phone along with an alert to inform them of the problem. This way, the monitoring of the vegetable bench becomes remote, facilitating the tracking of production, so that the producer does not need to check greenhouse by greenhouse, bench by bench, pipe by pipe, as well as avoiding production waste.
